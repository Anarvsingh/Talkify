# ‚ú® Full Stack Realtime Chat App ‚ú®

# Project Overview

This is a **Full Stack Realtime Chat Application** that allows users to communicate instantly with each other using real-time messaging powered by **Socket.io**. The application incorporates user authentication and authorization, online user status tracking, and error handling for a seamless chat experience. It also provides a clean and responsive UI, optimized for different screen sizes, using **TailwindCSS** and **Daisy UI**. 

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, with **MongoDB** for database management, ensuring scalability and security. JWT tokens are used for secure authentication and session management.

# Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS, Daisy UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary for image uploads and management
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Heroku/Render (Backend)

# How it Works

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**: 
   - Users can register and log in using JWT-based authentication.
   - Authorization ensures that only logged-in users can send messages and access the chat features.
   
2. **Real-time Messaging**: 
   - Powered by **Socket.io**, users can send and receive messages in real-time without page reloads.
   - The application ensures efficient message delivery and live updates for all connected users.

3. **Online User Status**:
   - The application tracks which users are online using Socket.io, showing real-time status updates within the chat interface.

4. **Global State Management**: 
   - Zustand is used for managing the global state of the application, such as user data and chat status, across different components.

5. **Error Handling**: 
   - Robust error handling is implemented both on the client and server side, ensuring smooth operation even in case of issues like network failures or invalid operations.
